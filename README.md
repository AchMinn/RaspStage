# SmartHome Dashboard

**SmartHome Dashboard** is a Django web application designed to log and visualize changes in a smart home environment. This application tracks various devices and their usage, providing insightful dashboards to monitor and analyze device consumption over time.

## Features

- **Device Management**: Add, update, and manage smart home devices, including lamps, plugs, and climate controls.
- **Consumption Tracking**: Record and visualize consumption data from devices.
- **Dashboard Visualizations**: Interactive charts display consumption data per device and per device type.
- **Date Range Filtering**: Filter data based on the last updated timestamp to focus on specific periods.
- **Change Logging**: Keep a history of changes made to device configurations and measurements.

## Project Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Django 3.2+
- PostgreSQL (recommended, but SQLite is also supported)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

	```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smarthome-dashboard.git
   cd smarthome-dashboard
 
2. **Create a Virtual Environment (if needed)**

	```bash
	python -m venv venv
	source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
 
3. **Install dependecies**

	```bash
	pip install -r requirements.txt

4. **Configure the database**
   	```bash
    	Update the DATABASES settings in your_project/settings.py to match your database configuration. By default, SQLite is used for simplicity.
    
5. **Run migrations**

	```bash
 	python manage.py migrate
 
6. **Create a superuser**
   	```bash
    	python manage.py createsuperuser
    
7. **Run the Development Server**
   	```bash
    	python manage.py runserver
    
Access the application at http://127.0.0.1:8000/.

## Usage

- **Access the Dashboard**: Navigate to the dashboard page at `/consumption/` to view device consumption data.
- **Filter Data**: Use the date range inputs to filter records by the `last_updated` timestamp.
- **View Charts**: Interactive charts will update based on the selected date range and display consumption statistics.
